# WeatherGen

-> STATUS: WORKING 

The next project I wanted to give a bit of graphic's a go. With C I decided on the SDL2 API. I've be busy learning the in's and out's.
Plus through it would be great to give Arena sytle memory management a go. So went ahead and sketched out both libs.

Therefor this is a little project that combines the two libs I wrote. 


First up was rain, but now that im thinking about it. perhaps building a complete weather system would be fun to be able to impletment in later projects.
More research needed :)
